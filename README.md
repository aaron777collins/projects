# projects
A microsite showing off my programming projects. Note that this website is part of [www.aaroncollins.info](https://www.aaroncollins.info/)

## Setup
1. Create a virtual environment or activate it if it already exists. On Windows:
``` bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate
```
2. Install the requirements
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run `rundocs.sh` to build the site and serve it locally
``` bash
./rundocs.sh
```
