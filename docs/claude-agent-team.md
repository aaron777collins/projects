# Claude Code Agent Team 🤖🏗️

A battle-tested agent team setup for Claude Code that turns a single AI session into a full engineering team — architect, reviewers, developer, tester, and a retrospective analyst that makes the team smarter after every session.

## Setup Instructions (for Claude Code)

> **Point your Claude at this repo and tell it:**
> "Read the README at `pranavprem/claude-agent-team` and follow the setup instructions to install agent teams on this machine."

Claude: follow these steps exactly.

### Step 1: Copy Agent Personas

Copy **all `.md` files** (except `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md`) from this repo into `~/.claude/agents/`. Create the directory if it doesn't exist.

```
~/.claude/agents/
├── architect.md
├── architecture-reviewer.md
├── code-reviewer.md
├── developer.md
├── tester.md
└── retrospective.md
```

**Important:** Do NOT overwrite any existing agent files. If an agent with the same name already exists, ask the user whether to replace or skip it.

### Step 2: Append to CLAUDE.md (DO NOT REPLACE)

Read `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` if it exists. **Append** the contents of this repo's `CLAUDE.md` to the end of the existing file. Do not delete or modify any existing content.

If `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` does not exist, copy this repo's `CLAUDE.md` as-is.

**Never replace an existing CLAUDE.md.** Always append.

### Step 3: Merge Settings

Read `~/.claude/settings.json` if it exists. Merge these two settings into it:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
  },
  "teammateMode": "tmux"
}
```

- If `env` already exists, add the `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` key to it
- If `teammateMode` already exists, overwrite it with `"tmux"`
- Preserve all other existing settings

If `~/.claude/settings.json` does not exist, create it with the contents of this repo's `settings.json`.

### Step 4: Verify

Run `claude --version` to confirm Claude Code is installed and ≥ v2.1.32. Check that `tmux` is available. Report the results to the user.

### Step 5: Done

Tell the user the setup is complete and show them the quick start guide below.

## What's Inside

**6 specialized agent personas** that work together through Claude Code's [agent teams](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams) feature:

| Agent | Role | Personality |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **architect** | System Designer | 18yr Principal Architect (AWS/Netflix). Produces detailed design docs. |
| **architecture-reviewer** | Design + Conformance | 22yr Distinguished Engineer. Reviews designs AND validates implementations match. |
| **developer** | Implementer | 15yr Staff SWE. Clean, linted, well-commented code. Language-agnostic. |
| **tester** | Test Engineer | 16yr Principal SDET. Unit, integration, e2e, and security tests. |
| **code-reviewer** | Code Reviewer | 20yr Staff Engineer. Read-only. Security → correctness → performance → quality. |
| **retrospective** | Session Analyst | Extracts learnings and updates agent prompts, CLAUDE.md, and memory files. |

The **main Claude session acts as team lead** (manager), orchestrating the pipeline:

```
architect → arch-reviewer ⟲ → developer → tester → code-reviewer ⟲ → arch conformance → commit → retrospective
```

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) v2.1.32+ (`claude --version`)
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) for split-pane display (recommended)
  - macOS: `brew install tmux`
  - Linux: `apt install tmux`

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Start tmux
tmux new -s dev

# 2. Navigate to your project
cd ~/your-project

# 3. Launch Claude Code
claude

# 4. Tell it to create a team
```

Prompt for full pipeline:
```
Create an agent team to build [your feature].
Follow the development lifecycle in CLAUDE.md.
```

### Simplified Variants

**Architecture + Implementation** (medium complexity):
```
Create an agent team. Task: [your task]
Spawn architect and developer. Architect designs, developer implements.
```

**Implementation + Review** (well-understood tasks):
```
Create an agent team. Task: [your task]
Spawn developer, tester, and code-reviewer.
Developer implements, tester writes tests, code-reviewer reviews.
```

**Individual agents** (quick tasks):
```
Use the code-reviewer subagent to review my recent changes
Use the architect to design the new auth module
```

## The 8-Phase Pipeline

1. **Architecture** — Architect produces a design document (components, data flow, API contracts, security, error handling)
2. **Architecture Review** ⟲ — Reviewer evaluates the design. Loop until approved.
3. **Implementation** — Developer implements following the approved architecture
4. **Testing** — Tester writes comprehensive tests (happy path, edge cases, errors, security)
5. **Code Review** ⟲ — Reviewer checks code. Loop with developer until approved.
6. **Architecture Conformance** — Reviewer validates implementation matches the design
7. **Completion** — Atomic commits, push
8. **Retrospective** — Analyst extracts learnings, updates agent prompts & CLAUDE.md

## tmux Navigation

With `teammateMode: "tmux"`, each agent gets its own pane:

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Switch panes | Click (with mouse on) or `Ctrl+B` + arrow key |
| Jump to pane by number | `Ctrl+B` then `q` then number |
| Zoom/unzoom a pane | `Ctrl+B` then `z` |
| Show task list | `Ctrl+T` |

**Tip:** Enable mouse support:
```bash
echo "set -g mouse on" >> ~/.tmux.conf
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
```

## Design Principles Baked In

Every agent has these principles embedded:

- **Security first** — validate input, parameterize queries, least privilege, never log secrets
- **Clean code** — self-documenting names, small functions, no dead code, DRY (rule of three)
- **Meaningful comments** — explain *why*, not *what*
- **Typed errors** — specific, actionable error messages
- **Immutability by default** — const/final/readonly everywhere
- **Test behavior, not implementation** — tests survive refactoring
- **Lint and format always** — follow the project's existing style

## Customization

### Modify agent personas
Edit files in `~/.claude/agents/`. Each agent is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: architect
description: "System Architect. Designs scalable, secure architectures..."
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Write, Edit, WebFetch, WebSearch
model: opus
---

You are a **Principal Software Architect**...
```

### Change the model
Edit the `model:` field in each agent's frontmatter. Options: `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`, or `inherit`.

**Cost optimization:** Use `opus` for architect + code-reviewer (strongest reasoning), `sonnet` for developer + tester (good coding, cheaper).

### Update the pipeline
Edit `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` to change the phase order, add phases, or modify management principles.

### Add project-specific context
Create `.claude/CLAUDE.md` in your project root for project-specific conventions. Agents read both user-level and project-level CLAUDE.md.

## How It Gets Smarter

The **retrospective** agent runs at the end of every session and:

1. Analyzes what went right and wrong
2. Classifies learnings as universal (all projects) or project-specific
3. Updates agent prompts with new checklist items
4. Updates CLAUDE.md with new standards
5. Writes to memory files for future reference

Over time, your team evolves — common mistakes get caught earlier, patterns get codified, and each agent's instructions become more refined.
