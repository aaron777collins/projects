## Welcome To The Documentation For My Github Projects
This microsite serves as a documentation hub for my projects. It is built using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). The site is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and is available at [www.aaroncollins.info/projects/](https://www.aaroncollins.info/projects/).
