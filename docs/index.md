## Welcome To The Documentation For Aaron Collins' Github Projects
This microsite serves as a documentation hub for my projects. It was built using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). The microsite is hosted via [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and is available at [www.aaroncollins.info/projects/](https://www.aaroncollins.info/projects/).

**Many projects haven't been documented here yet. Please visit my [Github](https://github.com/aaron777collins?tab=repositories) to see the rest of my projects.**
