### Manual Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aaron777collins/MinecraftPipes.git
cd MinecraftPipes

# Build the project
./scripts/build.sh

# Copy the generated files to your world
cp dist/pipes_datapack.zip /path/to/your/world/datapacks/
cp dist/pipes_resource_pack.zip /path/to/your/world/resourcepacks/
```

## 🛠️ Building from Source

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.11+** - Required for MDL
- **MDL (Minecraft Datapack Language)** - Install with `pip install minecraft-datapack-language`
- **Git** - For cloning the repository

### Build Commands
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aaron777collins/MinecraftPipes.git
cd MinecraftPipes

# Install MDL
pip install minecraft-datapack-language

# Build everything
./scripts/build.sh

# Or use npm scripts
npm run build
```

### Build Outputs
The build process creates the following files in the `dist/` directory:
- `pipes_datapack.zip` - The datapack with recipes and functions
- `pipes_resource_pack.zip` - The resource pack with custom 3D models and textures
- `pipes_complete.zip` - Combined package with both datapack and resource pack
- `README.md` - Installation and usage instructions

## 🎯 Usage

### Crafting Recipes

#### Pipe Inlet
```
I G I
G H G
I G I
```
- **I** = Iron Ingot
- **G** = Glass Pane  
- **H** = Hopper
- **Result**: Blue pipe inlet that extracts items when powered

#### Pipe Outlet
```
I G I
G D G
I G I
```
- **I** = Iron Ingot
- **G** = Glass Pane
- **D** = Dispenser
- **Result**: Green pipe outlet that deposits items automatically

#### Basic Pipe
```
I G I
G   G
I G I
```
- **I** = Iron Ingot
- **G** = Glass Pane
- **Result**: 4 gray pipes for connecting the system

#### Pipe Wrench
```
  I  
  I  
  S  
```
- **I** = Iron Ingot
- **S** = Stick
- **Result**: Yellow wrench for pipe maintenance

### Gameplay
1. **Craft the pipes** using the recipes above
2. **Place inlet pipes** next to chests you want to extract from
3. **Place outlet pipes** next to chests you want to deposit to
4. **Connect with basic pipes** to create a network
5. **Power inlet pipes** with redstone to start extraction
6. **Watch items flow** through your beautiful pipe system!

```

### Making Changes
1. **Edit MDL files** in `pipes/` for datapack logic
2. **Update models** in `assets/pipes/models/` for visual changes
3. **Modify textures** in `assets/pipes/textures/` for appearance
4. **Test locally** with `npm run build`
5. **Commit and push** to trigger CI/CD

### NPM Scripts
```bash
npm run build          # Full build process
npm run build:datapack # Build only the datapack
npm run build:resource # Build only the resource pack
npm run test           # Test the build process
npm run clean          # Clean build artifacts
npm run release        # Create a new version tag
```

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

### Automated Builds
- **Test Builds** - Run on every pull request and push
- **Release Builds** - Triggered by version tags
- **Manual Builds** - Can be triggered manually via GitHub Actions

### Creating Releases
```bash
# Create a version tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push --tags

# This automatically triggers a release build
```

Or manually trigger via GitHub Actions → Build and Release → Run workflow

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Items appear as regular iron ingots
- **Solution**: Make sure the resource pack is enabled in Minecraft settings

#### Recipes don't work
- **Solution**: Run `/reload` to reload the datapack

#### Build fails
- **Solution**: Check that MDL is installed with `pip install minecraft-datapack-language`

#### CI/CD fails
- **Solution**: Check GitHub Actions logs for specific error messages

### Getting Help
1. Check the [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) file for detailed build instructions
2. Review [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/aaron777collins/MinecraftPipes/issues) for known problems
